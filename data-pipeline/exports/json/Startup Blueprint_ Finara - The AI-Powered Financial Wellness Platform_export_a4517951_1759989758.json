            "title": "Risk Assessment",
            "content": "### 1. Regulatory & Compliance Risk (High)\n*   **Description:** The fintech industry is subject to strict regulations from bodies like the SEC and FINRA. Failure to comply can result in fines and operational shutdown.\n*   **Mitigation Strategy:**\n    *   Engage a fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) from day one, with a plan to hire a full-time Head of Compliance within 18 months.\n    *   Partner with a compliance-as-a-service provider (e.g., ComplyAdvantage) for KYC/AML checks.\n    *   Utilize Alpaca's broker-dealer infrastructure to offload many of the direct trading compliance burdens.\n\n### 2. Cybersecurity Risk (High)\n*   **Description:** As a custodian of sensitive personal and financial data, Finara is a prime target for cyberattacks. A breach would be catastrophic for user trust and brand reputation.\n*   **Mitigation Strategy:**\n    *   Implement bank-grade security measures: end-to-end encryption (AES-256), secure infrastructure on AWS, and strict access controls.\n    *   Achieve SOC 2 Type II certification within 18 months of launch.\n    *   Conduct regular third-party penetration tests and security audits.\n    *   Never store raw bank credentials; rely on tokenization from Plaid.\n\n### 3. Market Adoption Risk (Medium)\n*   **Description:** The fintech market is crowded. It may be challenging to acquire users and differentiate from established players.\n*   **Mitigation Strategy:**\n    *   Focus relentlessly on a superior, integrated user experience as the key differentiator.\n    *   Implement an aggressive, targeted go-to-market strategy focused on authentic engagement with the target demographic on platforms like TikTok and Reddit.\n    *   Build a strong community around the brand through content and education.\n\n### 4. Third-Party Dependency Risk (Medium)\n*   **Description:** Core functionality relies on APIs from Plaid (data aggregation) and Alpaca (trading). An outage or significant change in their pricing/terms could disrupt our service.\n*   **Mitigation Strategy:**\n    *   Architect our backend with an abstraction layer for these services, making it feasible to switch to an alternative provider if necessary.\n    *   Maintain strong business relationships with our key partners.\n    *   Develop robust monitoring and graceful degradation procedures for when a third-party service is down.\n\n### 5. Technical Risk (Medium)\n*   **Description:** The pressure for rapid feature development can lead to the accumulation of technical debt, hindering future agility. Additionally, scaling AI/ML models effectively requires specialized expertise and infrastructure.\n*   **Mitigation Strategy:**\n    *   Allocate 15-20% of each development cycle to refactoring, testing, and infrastructure improvements.\n    *   Establish a robust MLOps framework early on for model training, deployment, and monitoring.\n    *   Prioritize a strong engineering culture that values code quality and sustainable development."
