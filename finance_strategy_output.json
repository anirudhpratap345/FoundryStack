Angels can provide early capital, mentorship, and industry connections. Micro VCs are also a good fit as they specialize in early-stage investments and can offer strategic guidance. Accelerators can provide a structured program, initial funding, and access to a network of investors and mentors. Institutional VCs typically focus on larger Series A+ rounds. Corporate VCs are more strategic and often require significant traction. Government grants can be time-consuming and may not align with the rapid growth needed for a SaaS startup. Crowdfunding may not be suitable for a B2B SaaS model. Revenue-based financing is better suited for companies with established revenue streams, which a seed-stage startup may not have. Seed VCs may be an option, but the raise amount is on the lower end for their typical investment size, and they may prefer to see more traction.",
